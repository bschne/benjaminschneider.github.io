                        At the beginning of 2021, as most higher-education teaching was still being held online, I built <a href="https://remotestudentexchange.org" target="_blank">Remote Student Exchange</a> together with Johannes Haushofer at University of Stockholm, the Center for Effective Global Action at UC Berkley, and some volunteers. The platform aims to connect students from low- and middle income countries to professors at international universities for participation in their courses.

                    <p>During the summers of 2018 and 2020, I worked at <a href="https://www.digitalfestival.ch" target="_blank">Digital Festival</a> in Zurich and helped organize the three-day conference and the <a href="https://digitalfestival.ch/en/HACK/" target="_blank">HackZurich hackathon</a>.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>For the last few years, I've been helping out on the organizing team of <a href="http://scienceslamzurich.ch/" target="_blank">Science Slam Zurich</a>.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.ticketino.com" target="_blank">TICKETINO AG</a> in Zurich, I worked on relaunching the online shop in a new look and on a more state of the art technology stack (.NET Core).</p>
                    <p>I mostly took over the role of Product Owner together with the CTO, but was also involved in documentation, analyzing the existing business logic and writing code directly with the team of developers.</p>
                    <p>During my last year at the company, I lead the developer team directly reporting to the CTO. The role consisted of about equal parts product development and coordination of custom development projects between the client-facing project managers and the developers.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Me & <a href="https://www.maxwallner.com" target="_blank">Max Wallner</a> built a social betting game for european / world soccer championships called <a href="https://www.hellosepp.com" target="_blank">HelloSepp (currently offline)</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>During my (rather brief) time as a student at the <a href="https://www.unisg.ch" target="_blank">University of St. Gallen</a>, I was part of the team of <a href="https://www.startglobal.org" target="_blank">Start Global</a> and helped organize a two day student-run entrepreneurship conference on campus.</p>

            <p>I recently realized I kind of miss the old "link lists" websites used to have, so for lack of a better title, you can find some of my favourite online finds and regular reads/listens etc. over on <a href="nerd-stuff.html">this page.</a></p>
