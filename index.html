            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Switzerland and have been living in Zurich for the last few years. I am currently working at a software consultancy.</p> 
            <p>In my off time, I like to read, listen to all kinds of music, and tinker with random side projects.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Some projects I've been involved in.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>For the last two years, I've been helping out on the organizing team of <a href="http://scienceslamzurich.ch/" target="_blank">Science Slam Zurich</a>.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.ticketino.com" target="_blank">TICKETINO AG</a> in Zurich, I worked on relaunching the online shop in a new look and on a more state of the art technology stack (.NET Core).</p>
                    <p>I mostly took over the role of Product Owner together with the CTO, but was also involved in documentation, analyzing the existing business logic and writing code directly with the team of developers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Me & <a href="https://www.maxwallner.com" target="_blank">Max Wallner</a> built a social betting game for european / world soccer championships called <a href="https://www.hellosepp.com" target="_blank">HelloSepp (currently offline)</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>During my (rather brief) time as a student at the <a href="https://www.unisg.ch" target="_blank">University of St. Gallen</a>, I was part of the team of <a href="https://www.startglobal.org" target="_blank">Start Global</a> and helped organize a two day student-run entrepreneurship conference on campus.</p>
