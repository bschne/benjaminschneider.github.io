            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Some projects I've been involved in.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>During the summer of 2018, I briefly worked at <a href="https://www.digitalfestival.ch" target="_blank">Digital Festival</a> in Zurich and helped organize the three-day conference and the <a href="https://digitalfestival.ch/en/HACK/" target="_blank">HackZurich hackathon</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For the last two years, I've been helping out on the organizing team of <a href="http://scienceslamzurich.ch/" target="_blank">Science Slam Zurich</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.ticketino.com" target="_blank">TICKETINO AG</a> in Zurich, I worked on relaunching the online shop in a new look and on a more state of the art technology stack (.NET Core).</p>
                    <p>I mostly took over the role of Product Owner together with the CTO, but was also involved in documentation, analyzing the existing business logic and writing code directly with the team of developers.</p>
                    <p>During my last year at the company, I lead the developer team directly reporting to the CTO. The role consisted of about equal parts product development and coordination of custom development projects between the client-facing project managers and the developers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Me & <a href="https://www.maxwallner.com" target="_blank">Max Wallner</a> built a social betting game for european / world soccer championships called <a href="https://www.hellosepp.com" target="_blank">HelloSepp (currently offline)</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>During my (rather brief) time as a student at the <a href="https://www.unisg.ch" target="_blank">University of St. Gallen</a>, I was part of the team of <a href="https://www.startglobal.org" target="_blank">Start Global</a> and helped organize a two day student-run entrepreneurship conference on campus.</p>

            <h2>Nerd Stuff</h2>
            <p>I recently realized I kind of miss the old "link lists" websites used to have, so for lack of a better title, you can find some of my favourite online finds and regular reads/listens etc. over on <a href="nerd-stuff.html">this page.</a></p>
