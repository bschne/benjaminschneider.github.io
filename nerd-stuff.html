            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://worrydream.com" target="_blank">Bret Victor</a> did two of the most inspirational somewhat recent talks on Human Computer Interaction I've seen: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII" target="_blank">"Inventing on Principle"</a> about providing immediate feedback and direct interaction to make things understandable, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/115154289" target="_blank">"The Humane Representation of Thought"</a> about how we interact with technology and dynamic media, and what's missing from it.<br><br></li>

            <h3>Blogs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/" target="_blank">Marginal Revolution</a> - I don't know how two econ professors have time to post about 20 things a day, but you're sure to find some interesting stuff here.<br><br></li>

            <h3>Podcasts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank">99% Invisible</a> is an audio podcast about hidden design details and stories behind everyday things. Ever wondered what happens when a country <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/h-day/" target="_blank">switches from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right</a> (including a super catchy pop song), <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/all-rings-considered/" target="_blank">how custom ringtones got started in the 90s</a>, or what happens <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/structural-integrity/" target="_blank">when a student finds out a building in NYC is not all that stable</a>? Look no further.<br><br></li>
                <li><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/6nh3wk/102-long-distance" target="_blank">Reply All</a> calls itself "A Show About The Internet". While that sounds incredibly generic, the (very human) stories they tell are absolutely fascinating. Start with the time they <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/6nh3wk/102-long-distance" target="_blank">tracked down a scam callcenter</a> all the way to India, or listen to <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/76h967/127-the-crime-machine-part-i" target="_blank">this story about the NYPD</a> for a take on Goodhart's Law in practice.<br><br></li>
                <li>I am usually not too big on longform interviews, but the guests and rapid-fire questions asked by Tyler Cowen make <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/" target="_blank">Conversations with Tyler</a> a great exception and one of my more regular listens.</li>

            <h2>Art & Design</h2>
            <p>Definitely more to follow here... :-)</p>
            <!-- TODO: Movies / Art of the Title -->
            <!-- TODO: Monument valley & Aaalto's Adventure -->
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.artofthetitle.com/" target="_blank">Art of the Title</a> collects interesting movie title sequences, including background information on production etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Architecture & Interiors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bêka &amp; Lemoine wanted to do a documentary about a private residence designed by Rem Koolhaas. Instead of going for the usual glossy shots and grandiose expert statements, they followed the cleaning lady around and show a lot of its flaws and idiosyncrasies with some really subtle humor - <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/koolhaashouselife/188058730" target="_blank">Trailer & Streaming on Vimeo.</a><br><br></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.freundevonfreunden.com/" target="_blank">Freunde von Freunden</a> is one of my favourite interior design blogs. They follow a classic "homestory" format, but all of the apartments/houses are incredibly cool. Some personal favorites: This <a href="https://www.freundevonfreunden.com/interviews/catherine-gay-menzel-and-goetz-menzel/" target="_blank">architect couple in Switzerland</a>, this <a href="https://www.freundevonfreunden.com/interviews/siemens-home-appliances-deventer-de-grijze-silo" target="_blank">incredible view on top of an old silo</a>, and one of the craziest places I've ever seen, Karen &amp; Christan Boros' <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130722115959/https://www.freundevonfreunden.com/interviews/karen-and-christian-boros/" target="_blank">art-filled loft on top of an above-ground bunker</a> in Berlin.<br><br></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Misc.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://atlasofplaces.com/" target="_blank">Atlas of Places</a> collects... a lot of different things? It includes architecture, cinema, photography, and more.</li>

                <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=from%20nand%20to%20tetris" target="_blank">Fron Nand to Tetris</a> is a series of two courses that take you through building a small CPU from basic logic gates, building an assembler, all the way to a small high-level language. Tons of fun, especially if you don't have a background in low-level stuff but are curious about it!</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a>, run by NYU Professor Daniel Shiffman, has really fun coding tutorials. They are mostly focused towards creative coding for some appealing visual output (using processing or p5.js), but cover some basic CS topics and interesting simulations along the way.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a> makes great math explainer videos, focused on providing intuitive ways to understand things and showing unexpected connections between topics.</li>
