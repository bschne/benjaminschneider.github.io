                <p>I recently attended a workplace session about, broadly speaking, “what is new and might have a meaningful impact on us” in terms of innovation and consumer trends. Given the recent weeks, it was only a matter of time until someone brought up ChatGPT asking for some guidance or an assessment of its potential.</p>

                <p>A common sentiment among some not-too-technical audience members was somewhere along the lines of “it’s obviously all the rage, but we don’t know how productive it will be and in what form, and there’s a bunch of unsolved concerns about copyright w.r.t. using the output”. A markedly less subtle version of that last concern came up in response to the younger of the two hosts casually mentioning she’d been using it to help out with some writing assignments.</p>

                <p>At another company I visited sometime last December, a senior executive said his team had tinkered around and found it a great help in brainstorming and coming up with some texts for the new firm-wide strategy they were currently working on. He’d also used it to come up with a story to read to his daughter at bedtime and illustrated it using Midjourney.</p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Spot the difference.</p>

                <p>Given recent progress and the role of a handful of tech companies in our lives, it is reasonable to stop for a minute and ask yourself what parts of this new world you want, and what parts you don’t. I’m an unabashed lover of innovation and progress in general, but also take the occasional breather and wonder whether something serves us or the other way around. We humans invented this stuff, we’re in charge here!</p>

                <span class="image-caption">Also a good approach to technology, IMO</span>

                <p>But I don’t think there is a decision between being a naive technological progress zealot vs. spending your days debating the last shred of potential harm before deciding whether you can get into some new development or had better not touch it here.</p>

                <p>The nice thing about ChatGPT and similar products is that the technology is in some ways quite transparent and accessible. You can’t exactly build your own at this scale. But you can go read the actual papers if you have some technical knowledge. You can learn to build a simpler version. You can follow advances in understanding what actually goes on inside models at this scale.</p>

                <p>And if you don’t have the technical chops or don’t want to spend the time, you can just sign up and get a feeling for what it can and cannot do — for you specifically, or more broadly. We’re luckily not discussing whether we should hand over all our work to these systems quite yet.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of ongoing concerns — be it about low-paid workers training the models to not generate anything offensive, about copyright infringement by training on existing text- or image data without the authors' consent, the energy use of training a model of this scale, the list goes on. But at the margin, these are hardly caused or exacerbated by you asking ChatGPT to write a funny poem or checking if it can answer a few questions about your area of expertise accurately. And if you want to do something about problems like these and be a part of the conversation, you’re in a much better position if you know as much about the technology in question as you can.</p>
