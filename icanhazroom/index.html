            <p>I'm 28 years old and originally from Basel, though I grew up in Glarus (or rather <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braunwald_GL" target="_blank">here</a>, to be more precise) and have been living in Zurich for about six years now.</p>
            <p>After a short time away, I'm looking to move back to Zurich with a flexible move date sometime soon.</p>

            <h2>What do you do? Who are you?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently working part-time in software engineering &amp; UX design, while studying computer science &amp; economics at the University of Zurich (Bachelor's, my CV got a bit weird somewhere along the way ðŸ˜…)
            </p>
            <p>
                I also do some other stuff, e.g. I built <a href="https://remotestudentexchange.org" target="_blank">remotestudentexchange.org</a>, or usually help organizing <a href="http://digitalfestival.ch" target="_blank">Digital Festival</a> and <a href="https://hackzurich.com" target="_blank">HackZurich</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If someone asks "what are your hobbies?" I always blank for a second because there's barely any "classic" hobbies I've pursued consistently for a long time. That being said I really like to read, go for occasional runs, bike rides &amp; hikes, take pictures, discover new music or movies, try my hand at cooking, ...

            <h2>What are you like as a flatmate?</h2>
            <p>Obviously very clean and respectful! (Does anyone ever not say that? ðŸ¤”)</p>
            <p>I like getting along well with my flatmates and sharing the occasional meal or drink if it happens to line up, but also need my alone time since I am usually kind of busy between work, studying, and other projects. I will happily join any flat parties, but probably not organize my own except for having a friend or two over for dinner every once in a while.</p>
            <p>I've lived in shared flats for most of my ~6 years in Zurich.</p>

            <h2>Can we stalk you online?</h2>
            <p>Sure thing! Here's every profile I can think of that I still use and isn't old enough to be really, really embarrassing. Come to think of it, my LinkedIn picture is also kind of embarrassing. Please don't judge ðŸ˜¬</p>
