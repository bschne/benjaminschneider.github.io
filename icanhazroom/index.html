            <p>I'm 27 years old and originally from Basel, though I grew up in Glarus (or rather <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braunwald_GL" target="_blank">here</a>, to be more precise) and have been living in Zurich for about six years now.</p>
            <p>I'm looking for a new place to live from <b>April 1st</b> since my sublease is running out (a few days earlier would also work).</p>

            <h2>What do you do? Who are you?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently working part-time in software engineering &amp; UX design, while studying computer science &amp; economics at the University of Zurich (Bachelor's, my CV got a bit weird somewhere along the way ðŸ˜…)
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have some side projects, like building <a href="https://remotestudentexchange.org" target="_blank">remotestudentexchange.org</a>, or occasionally organizing <a href="http://scienceslamzurich.ch" target="_blank">Science Slams</a> in Zurich.
            </p>
            <p>
                If someone asks "what are your hobbies?" I always blank for a second because there's barely any "classic" hobbies I've pursued consistently for a long time. That being said I really like to read, go for occasional runs, bike rides &amp; hikes, take pictures, discovering new music or movies, ...

            <h2>What are you like as a flatmate?</h2>
            <p>Obviously very clean and respectful! (Does anyone ever not say that? ðŸ¤”)</p>
            <p>I like getting along well with my flatmates and sharing the occasional meal or drink, but also need my alone time since I am usually kind of busy between work, studying, and other projects.</p>
            <p>I've lived in shared flats for most of my ~6 years in Zurich.</p>

            <h2>Can we stalk you online?</h2>
            <p>Sure thing! Here's every profile I can think of that I still use and isn't old enough to be really, really embarrassing. Come to think of it, my LinkedIn picture is also kind of embarrassing. Please don't judge ðŸ˜¬</p>
